In 1977 Pnueli introduced the linear temporal logic, a temporal logic to specify properties of paths in reactive systems~\cite{pnueli1977temporal}. Since then it has been a popular choice for such purpose and there have been a larger number of papers that have studied efficient algorithms for linear temporal logic satisfiability and model checking. In this paper, we propose the use of linear temporal logic as the basis for confidentiality and integrity information flow policies in a provenance-preserving graph-based data repository. A proof of concept software system has been implemented to illustrate the theory of the paper.
