In 1977 Pnueli introduced the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), a temporal logic to specify properties of paths in reactive systems~\cite{pnueli1977temporal}. Since then it has been a popular choice for such purpose and there have been a larger number of papers that have studied efficient algorithms for LTL satisfiability and model-checking. Not many seem to have explored the possibility of extending the LTL grammar. In this paper we propose an extension of the LTL grammar, where the additions to the grammar make it suitable for composing context aware policies for reading and writing data to a provenance-preserving graph-based data repository.
