The problem this paper addresses requires that a property formula is verified against a transition system. Multiple approaches can be used to check if a transition system satisfy the properties, when the properties are defined by LTL formulae.

Two solutions has been implemented by \cite{jpsember} and \cite{serejke}. The solutions verify whether a LTL formula holds under a transition system or not by transforming the negation of the formulae themselves and the model of the system, which is described as a Kripke model, to equivalent BÃ¼chi automatons. The product of the two automatons is then created and checked if it accepts infinite strings.
