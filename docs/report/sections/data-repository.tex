\section{Data Repository}\label{sec:data-repository}
% How is the data repository modelled.
When thinking of what a data repository is, words like ``tuple spaces'', ``databases'' or even ``comma-separated files'' might spring to mind. However, to utilize LTL formulae to specify properties about the data and their provenance in the repository, it is necessary to carefully consider what data repository abstraction to use. 

% Paragraph:
% - Make the connection to transition systems
In the literature (Baier and Katoen, 2008)\cite{baier2008principles} use a Transition System (TS) without terminal states as a reactive system, for which they are checking LTL formulae against. The following definition of a TS is used:
\begin{definition}[Transition System (TS)~{\cite[Def.~2.1]{baier2008principles}}]\label{def:ts}
A \emph{transition system} $TS$ is a tuple $\left(S, \longrightarrow, I, AP, L \right)$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $S$ is a set of data states
  \item $\longrightarrow \subseteq S \times S$ is a transition relation
  \item $I \subseteq S$ is a set of initial states
  \item $AP$ is a set of atomic propositions
  \item $L : S \rightarrow 2^{AP}$ is a labelling function
\end{itemize}
Note that the actions on transition labels have been omitted as they are not relevant in this setting.
\end{definition}

To model a data repository as a TS, one could consider data resources from the data repository as states in the TS and dependencies between data resources as transitions between states. Let $r_i$ and $r_j$ be data resources in the same data repository $DR$, and let $r_i$ be derived fully or partially from $r_j$, i.e. information from $r_j$ was used when creating $r_i$. Then there exists a dependency from $r_i$ to $r_j$. As an example consider a data repository of scientific papers, i.e. each paper is a data resource. Say this paper is the data resource $r$ in the data repository. Then $r$ would have a dependency to each of the papers it references, as the information from those references was used when composing this paper. It could also be that a dependency exists to a resource that defines rules about the format of the paper. This is what is referred to as a policy and will be introduced in a later section. Modeling dependencies in this way inherently describes the past and if you were to follow the dependencies from a data resource they would paint a picture of how that resource got to be. This is contrary to transitions in a TS, which describes something about the future.

% Paragraph: 
% - No terminal states
As mentioned (Baier and Katoen, 2008)\cite{baier2008principles} use a TS without any terminal states to ensure that all paths and traces in the TS are infinite. To achieve infinite paths and thereby infinite traces in the data repository modeled as a TS, all data resources without any dependencies to other data resources have a dependency to itself, a so-called \emph{self-loop}. A self-loop implies that the data resource was created independently from any other data resource. By introducing self-loops one ensures that no terminal state can ever be reached or will even exist in the data repository, and as a result all paths in the data repository are infinite.

% Paragraph: 
% - AP
% - Labelling function
In a TS a set of atomic propositions is related to a state by the labeling function. On the other hand, in a data repository, it is desired to have attribute names and values being mapped to a data resource. Attribute names are simply names that map to a value that is given by a literal.

% Paragraph: 
% - Initial states
According to \autoref{def:ts} the initial states of a TS should be explicitly defined. However, it is not desirable that the data repository itself should restrict, which data resources can and can not be read, i.e. be the initial state in the data repository. Therefore there is no need for the data repository to keep track of the initial data resources.

Whereas a TS does not store the LTL formulae themselves, it is desired to keep track of the policy formulae, which are introduced in \autoref{sec:grammar}, as well as being able to map a data resource to a policy formula.

% Summarize the definition of a data repository
Given all of the above descriptions we define a data repository as follows:
\begin{definition}[Data Repository (DR)]
A \emph{data repository} $DR$ is a tuple $\DR$, where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $R$ is a set of data resources
  \item $\longrightarrow \subseteq R \times R$ is a dependency relation
  \item $A$ is a finite set of attribute names
  \item $L$ is a set of literals
  \item $M : R \times A \rightharpoonup L$ is a partial mapping from data resources and attributes to literals
  \item $F$ is a set of policy formulae
  \item $P : R \rightarrow F$ is a mapping from data resources to policy formulae
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Data repository]\label{ex:data-repo}
Let us consider how a data repository $\DR$ with five data resources, that is $R = \left\{ r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_4 \right\}$, could look like. \autoref{fig:data-repo} shows how the five data resources could depend on each other, i.e. how $\longrightarrow$ is defined. The data resource $r_5$ has dependencies to $r_3$ and $r_4$, $r_3$ has a dependency to $r_1$ and $r_4$ has a dependency to $r_2$. The data resources $r_1$ and $r_2$ was created completely independently and have no dependency to other resources, thus they have a \emph{self-loop}.
\begin{figure}[!ht] 
    \begin{center}
        \input{figs/data-repository-example.tex}
        \caption{Sample data repository containing five data resources, their dependencies, attribute names and literals.}
        \label{fig:data-repo}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The set of attribute names $A$ and the set of literals $L$ are defined as follows
\begin{align*}
    A &= \left\{ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_4 \right\} \\
    L &= \left\{ l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4, l_4 \right\}
\end{align*}
From \autoref{fig:data-repo} the mapping of a data resource and an attribute name to a literal can be seen, e.g. $M(r_1, a_1) = l_1$. Note the set of policy formulae $F$ and the mapping from data resources to policy formulae $P$ has been omitted in this example as it will be introduced later in \autoref{sec:policies}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Context}
A context is introduced, where the main purpose of the context is to populate values that can be used in resolving policy formulae that follow the grammar in \autoref{sec:grammar}. The context is defined as follows:
\begin{definition}[Context]
A \emph{context} $c$ is a tuple $\CON$, where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s$ is a $user$ literal corresponding to the current subject
    \item $U$ is a set of $usr$ literals
    \item $I$ is a set of $str$ literals
    \item $N : I \rightarrow U$ is a mapping from user identities to user literals
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The primary value of concern is the current subject $s$, i.e. the name of the user/person performing operations against the data repository. The implementation abstracts away from authenticating the user, i.e. ensuring that the user is whom he/she claims to be. However, it should be trivial to see that an authentication system could be placed as a layer on top of the work presented in this paper.

In theory, there is no limit to what the context could be extended with, e.g. the system that the operation is performed from, the name of the system, etc.
