\subsection{Policies}\label{sec:policies}
The language of PF introduced in \autoref{sec:grammar} allows one to express properties of paths in a data repository. In the following sections, two new concepts for information flow policies will be introduced, namely, confidentiality and integrity policies.

\subsubsection{Confidentiality Policies}
The concept of confidentiality polices is introduced to allow the user of the system to control how information flows in the future. A confidentiality policy is defined as:
\begin{definition}[Confidentiality policy]\label{def:cp}
A confidentiality policy $\conf$ is an UPF $\upf$ where the formulae is constructed from the language described by the grammar in \autoref{tab:pf-grammar-user}.
\end{definition}
It should be noted that like any other LTL formulae, multiple policies can be defined and concatenated with conjunction. As shown later in \autoref{sec:put} a data resource is associated with a confidentiality policy once the resource is placed in the data repository. 

There are no restrictions on who can depend on a data resource, however, a confidentiality policy will impose constraints on who can read the data resource through a query operation. One might wonder why it makes sense to have one data resource depend on another if the confidentiality policy restricts one from querying it. However, this does open up for the possibility to have a data resource with a corresponding confidentiality policy defined, where the policy can be used as a template for dependant resources through inheritance.

% - Inheritance of policies
Before looking into how one can create these constraints and take advantage of them, it is necessary to explain how confidentiality policies are inherited. The dependencies of a data resource imply that it inherits the dependencies' confidentiality policy, which are inherited policies themselves. The inherited policies are concatenated with conjunction to form one composite policy. As the concatenation is done with conjunction, it means that all inherited policies and the policy that is directly associated with the data resource must be satisfied. Furthermore, this results in that the inherited confidentiality policy will always be as or more restrictive, compared to its individual policies. More formally the confidentiality policy inheritance can be defined as:
\begin{definition}[Confidentiality policy inheritance]\label{def:cpi}
Given a data repository $\DR$ and a data resource $r \in R$ the inherited confidentiality policy $\iconf(DR, r)$ is recursively defined as:
\begin{equation*}
    \iconf(DR, r) = P(r) \land \bigwedge\limits_{r \longrightarrow r' \mid r \neq r'} \iconf(DR, r')
\end{equation*}
The inherited confidentiality policy $\iconf(DR, r)$ is only well-defined if the data repository is acyclic. However, self-loops are ignored, i.e. relations of the form $r \longrightarrow r$. This guarantees that $\iconf(DR, r)$ is a finite policy formula.
\end{definition}

Let us look at an example to visualise the inheritance.
\begin{example}[Confidentiality policy inheritance]
Consider the data repository containing five data resources $r_1\ldots r_5$ illustrated in \autoref{fig:policy-inher}. The data resources $r_1$ and $r_2$ do not have any dependencies, $r_3$ has a dependency to $r_1$, $r_4$ has one to $r_2$ and finally $r_5$ has a dependency to both $r_3$ and $r_4$. Each data resource $r_i$ was placed in the data repository with a corresponding confidentiality policy $\conf_i$.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \begin{center}
        \input{figs/policy-inheritance-example.tex}
        \caption{Inheritance of confidentiality policies.}
        \label{fig:policy-inher}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Given the data repository $DR$ in \autoref{fig:policy-inher}, the inherited confidentiality policies of $r_1$ and $r_2$ are $\iconf(DR, r_1) = \conf_1$ and $\iconf(DR, r_2) = \conf_2$. This is expected as they have no dependencies other than a self-loop. Considering the resources $r_3$ and $r_4$ we get $\iconf(DR, r_3) = \conf_3 \land \conf_1$ and $\iconf(DR, r_4) = \conf_4 \land \conf_2$, which is expected as they have a dependency to $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively. Finally $\iconf(DR, r_5) = \conf_5 \land \conf_4 \land \conf_3 \land \conf_2 \land \conf_1$ as every resource can be reached from $r_5$ through its dependencies.
\end{example}

Now that it is clear how confidentiality policies are inherited, it is possible to consider how to create constraints. Creating constraints is achieved by utilizing the temporal and propositional logic operators as well as the newly introduced functions and predicates to the grammar in \autoref{tab:pf-grammar-user}. In the following, a set of examples will be given to illustrate how constraints can be created through confidentiality policies and the versatility of the language. The examples will use the simple data repository shown in \autoref{fig:conf-policy} as reference if needed.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \begin{center}
        \input{figs/confidentiality-policy-examples.tex}
        \caption{Data repository containing 3 data resources $r_1, r_2, r_3$.}
        \label{fig:conf-policy}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[Trust and distrust of authors]\label{ex:conf-reader-constraints}
Let us start by looking at how one could introduce constraints about who can use a data resource, i.e. query the data resources in the repository and read the contents of it. This can be achieved by introducing a blacklist containing the names of those users who are not allowed to query the data resource. Here the \emph{user} and \emph{subject} functions will become useful, where the subject can be considered as the reader. Considering the data repository $DR$ in \autoref{fig:conf-policy} and say that \emph{Alice} placed $r_1$ in $DR$ and she wish that the users \emph{Mallory} and \emph{Monroe} are restricted from querying the data resource. Adding the following confidentiality policy solves this desire:
\begin{align*}
    \conf_{black} \eqdef subject() \neq user(Mallory) \land subject() \neq user(Monroe)
\end{align*}
However, with $\conf_{black}$ every other user is allowed to query the resources, which might not be the desired outcome. Instead, one could take an approach that is commonly used when defining IP tables, blacklist every IP address by default and explicitly define the allowed ones, i.e. whitelist trusted IP addresses. Taking such an approach and assume that \emph{Alice} would allow herself and \emph{Bob} to query $r_1$, results in the confidentiality policy:
\begin{align*}
    \conf_{white} \eqdef subject() = user(Alice) \lor subject() = user(Bob)
\end{align*}
Note that the equalities in $\conf_{black}$ are concatenated with conjunction whereas they are concatenated with disjunction in $\conf_{white}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Avoid inheritance]\label{ex:avoid}
Let us start off by clarifying that inheritance can not be avoided, however, it is possible to create a confidentiality policy such that it is relevant in the data resource to which it was added but irrelevant when inherited. To achieve this it will be necessary to utilize the $self$ predicate and implication. For a revisit of the $self$ predicate, we point to \autoref{def:pf-user-to-internal}. With this the following confidentiality policy can be created where $\conf_1$ is an arbitrary policy:
\begin{align*}
    \conf \eqdef self \imply \conf_1
\end{align*}
Say $r_1$ was placed in $DR$, shown in \autoref{fig:conf-policy}, with $\conf$. This means that $\conf_1$ should hold under $DR$ with respect to $r_1$ and some context $c$ to successfully query it. However when querying $r_2$ or $r_3$, which has a dependency to $r_1$, $\conf$ is trivially true.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Author is only reader]\label{ex:conf-reader-author}
A way of ensuring that the author and only the author can query a data resource in a data repository can be achieved by using the \emph{author} attribute name and \emph{subject} function, where the subject can be considered as the reader. Say that $r_1$ is placed in $DR$ as shown in \autoref{fig:conf-policy} with the confidentiality policy:
\begin{align*}
    \conf \eqdef subject() = author
\end{align*}
Then only the author of $r_1$ is allowed to query and read it. The author attribute is added to a data resource automatically during a \emph{put} operation as will be further explained in \autoref{sec:put}. With the given policy $\conf$, $r_1$ can be considered a template and as a result of inheritance, $r_2$ and $r_3$ in $DR$ can only be read by their authors, i.e. the person who performed the \emph{put} to place them in the data repository.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Anonymised data resources]
Now consider the case of constructing a confidentiality policy that ensures that some property between two data resources holds in $DR$. Say the confidentiality policy $\conf$ is associated to $r_1$, and when querying for $r_3$ it is desired that $\conf$ should ensure that $r_2$ is anonymised. This can be achieved by using the \emph{self} predicate, implication as well as the temporal operators \emph{next} and \emph{until}. Defining the policy as and assuming that $r_2$ has an atomic proposition \emph{anonymised}, it is possible to achieve exactly that:
\begin{align*}
    \conf \eqdef \lnot self \imply \X \left( anonymised \U self \right)
\end{align*}
Let us break it down and justify the construction of it by investigating the behavior when querying $r_1$, $r_2$ and $r_3$. This is under the assumption that a context $c$ is given.

When querying for $r_1$, the left side of the implication is false and the implication is trivially true, thus $DR \models_{c,r_1} \conf$. 

When querying for $r_2$, the left side of the implication is true, so the right side has to be true as well, for the implication to be true. Given that the \emph{next} operator refers to $r_1$, as it is the direct dependency of $r_2$, $DR$ should satisfy $anonymised \U self$ given $r_1$. As \emph{self} is a reference to $r_1$ it follows that $DR \models_{c,r_1} anonymised \U self$ and thus $DR \models_{c,r_2} \conf$.

When querying for $r_3$, the left side of the implication is true, so the right side has to be true as well, for the implication to be true. Given that the \emph{next} operator refers to $r_2$, as it is the direct dependency of $r_3$, $DR$ should satisfy $anonymised \U self$ given $r_2$. The \emph{self} predicate refers to $r_1$ and can not be satisfied in $r_2$, thus the left side of the \emph{until} should be true, which it is as $r_2$ has the atomic proposition $anonymised$. It was shown that $DR \models_{c,r_1} anonymised \U self$ and from this it follows that $DR \models_{c,r_2} anonymised \U self$, which finally means $DR \models_{c,r_3} \conf$.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Integrity Policies}
Confidentiality policies are concerned with imposing constraints on the information flow in a data repository. On the other hand integrity policies are concerned with guaranteeing provenance insurance whenever data resources are queried in a data repository.
\begin{definition}[Integrity policy]\label{def:ip}
An integrity policy $\inte$ is an UPF $\upf$ where the formulae are constructed from the language described by the grammar in \autoref{tab:pf-grammar-user}.
\end{definition}
It should be noted that like any other LTL formulae or confidentiality policies, multiple policies can be defined and concatenated with conjunction, to construct a single integrity policy.

As already suggested an integrity policy is associated with a \emph{query}, as opposed to a confidentiality policy which is associated to a data resource. This means that an integrity policy is not persistent in the data repository but its lifespan is as long as the \emph{query} operation. This will be explained further in \autoref{sec:query}.

Let us now consider how integrity policies can be constructed by utilizing the temporal and propositional logic operators as well as the newly introduced functions and predicates to the grammar in \autoref{tab:pf-grammar-user}. In the following, a set of examples will be given to illustrate how constraints can express properties of provenance through the domain of integrity policies.

\begin{example}[]\label{ex:mutual-exclusion}
Let us start by considering how one could formulate an integrity policy that ensures that the data resource and its dependencies do not have two given atomic propositions at the same time. Say that it desired to query a data resource if it or any of its dependencies does not contain the atomic proposition $a$ and $b$ at the same time. The following integrity policy $\inte$ specifies exactly that utilizing the temporal operator \emph{always}:
\begin{align*}
    \inte \eqdef  \G \left( \lnot a \lor \lnot b \right)
\end{align*}
Consider the data repository $DR$ shown in \autoref{fig:inte-policy-mutual-exclusion}.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \begin{center}
        \input{figs/integrity-policy-mutual-exclusion-example.tex}
        \caption{Data repository containing four data resources $r_1, \ldots, r_4$.}
        \label{fig:inte-policy-mutual-exclusion}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Given the data repository $DR$, some context $c$ and the integrity policy $\inte$ it is possible to query for $r_1, r_2$ and $r_3$ as $\inte$ holds under $DR$ with respect to $c$ and those data resources. However $\inte$ does not hold under $DR$ with respect to $r_4$ as $r_4$ contains $a$ and $b$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[No distrusted author until trusted author]
It could very well be that it is desired to query a data resource with some restrictions on the author of the dependencies. Say that when querying for a data resource $r_i$, one wants the resource to have a dependency to some other resource $r_j$ which was created by the user \emph{Bob}, where no resource in between $r_i$ and $r_j$ was created by the user \emph{Mallory}. Utilizing the \emph{author} attribute name and the \emph{until} operator an integrity policy can be formulated that specifies this:
\begin{align*}
    \inte \eqdef author \neq user(Mallory) \U author = user(Bob)
\end{align*}
Consider the data repository $DR$ given in \autoref{fig:inte-policy-independent-author} and some context $c$.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \begin{center}
        \input{figs/integrity-policy-independent-author-example.tex}
        \caption{Data repository containing six data resources $r_1, \ldots, r_6$.}
        \label{fig:inte-policy-independent-author}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Let us start by considering if $\inte$ holds under $DR$ when querying for $r_5$. As no data resource on the path from $r_5$ to $r_2$ was created by \emph{Mallory} and $r_2$ was created by \emph{Bob}, then is $\inte$ verified. As $\inte$ is verified when reaching $r_2$ it is unnecessary to consider the remaining of the path being $r_1$. For the same reasons $\inte$ holds under $DR$ when querying for $r_3$ and $r_2$ as well.

Now consider if $\inte$ holds under $DR$ when querying for $r_6$. As the direct dependency $r_4$ of $r_6$ was created by \emph{Mallory} the integrity policy $\inte$ is violated and thus $\inte$ does not hold under $DR$ when querying for $r_6$, as well as for $r_4$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Trusted authors]
A data repository is naive in the sense that it does not take the trustworthiness of the authors into consideration, that is up the user performing the query to specify the users that it trust or does not trust. This can be done in a few different ways, all of which has its advantages and disadvantages.

The first way is to take the blacklist approach, the same concept as was used in \autoref{ex:conf-reader-constraints}. Assuming that the user performing the query for a data resource does not trust the users \emph{Mallory} and \emph{Monroe} and thus do not trust any data resources they have placed in the data repository. The following integrity policy $\inte_1$ ensures that a data resource is not returned if it was created by those users or has a dependency to a resource that they created.
\begin{align*}
    \inte_1 \eqdef \G( author \neq user(Mallory) \land author \neq user(Monroe))
\end{align*}

Another way is the whitelist approach which was also introduced in \autoref{ex:conf-reader-constraints}. Assuming that the user performing the query only consider \emph{Alice} and \emph{Bob} for trustworthy authors of data resources and thus only wants to query a data resource if it and all its dependencies were created by one of them. This can be achieved by using the integrity policy $\inte_2$:
\begin{align*}
    \inte_2 \eqdef \G(author = user(Alice) \lor author = user(Bob))
\end{align*}

A third way could be that the user performing the query is not too concerned if the data resource being queried and its dependencies were created by trustworthy authors as long as either the resource itself or one of it dependencies was. Again assuming that \emph{Alice} and \emph{Bob} are considered trustworthy the following integrity policy $\inte_3$ impose exactly that constraint:
\begin{align*}
    \inte_3 \eqdef \F(author = user(Alice) \lor author = user(Bob))
\end{align*}

Finally, it could be that the user does not want data resources created by a distrusted author unless it has been sanitized by a trusted author. Assuming \emph{Mallory} is a distrusted author and \emph{Alice} is a trusted author, the integrity policy $\inte_4$ impose that constraint:
\begin{align*}
    \inte_4 \eqdef \G author \neq user(Mallory) \lor author \neq user(Mallory) \U author = user(Alice)
\end{align*}
\end{example}
