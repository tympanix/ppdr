\section{Project to make}
A proof-of-concept data repository with the incorporation of provenance-preserving confidentiality and integrity policies. Policies are expressed through resource formulas and are inspired by first order logic. The project aims to show how GDPR and data privacy can be accommodated in future database systems.
