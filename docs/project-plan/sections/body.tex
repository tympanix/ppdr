\section{Project to make}
A proof-of-concept data repository with the incorporation of provenance-preserving confidentiality and integrity policies. Policies are expressed through resource formulas and are inspired by first order logic. The project aims to show how GDPR and data privacy can be accommodated in future database systems.

\section{MoSCoW model}
\paragraph{Must implement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resource repository
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Client/server model
        \item History of resource relationships
    \end{itemize}
    \item Structure of data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resources with attributes
        \item Resources modelled by acyclic graph
    \end{itemize}
    \item Operations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Put/query
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Should implement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Policies
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DSL for resource formulas (inspired by FOL)
        \item Confidentiality policy for resources
        \item Integrity policy for queries
    \end{itemize}
    \item Access control system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensures policies are upheld
        \item Identities (simple password based authentication)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Could implement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functions to derive new data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item New resources can be computed from aggregated resources
        \item E.g. min, max, mean, median
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Will not implement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Security
    \begin{itemize}
        \item End-to-end encryption
    \end{itemize}
    \item Distributed system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item P2P structure with DHT (maybe blockchain)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Trustworthiness of resources
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resources have a “trust score” which is inherited transitively
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Timeline}
\paragraph{Week 34}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read material regarding Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and First Order Logic (FOL) (primarily \cite{baier2008principles})
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 35}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deadline for decision of LTL or FOL including other major design decisions
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 36-37}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of requirements from the \emph{must} section of the MoSCoW model
    \item Begin design section of report with considerations of LTL versus FOL
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 38-43}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation oriented period with some report writing
    \item Implementation of requirements from the \emph{should} section of the MoSCoW model
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 44-47}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Report oriented period with some implementation
    \item Implementation of requirements from the \emph{could} section of the MoSCoW model
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 48}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preparations for hand in of report draft
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 49}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hand in draft of report for feedback. Preferably no later than \nth{4} December
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 50-51}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Receive feedback and adjust report accordingly
    \item Probably little to no code improvements in this period
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Week 52-1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Final preparations for hand in - readthrough of report and source code
    \item Hand in project
\end{itemize}
